Under construction OrientDB node.js driver.

Currently this driver implements the OrientDB binary protocol but the plan is to provide both the HTTP and the binary protocol.

This is a node.js driver for OrientDB. This has some roots in christk's node-mongodb-native and in yojimbo87's east OrientDB drivers.
